# chillput()
small python3 learning script. chillput() is a function to prompt for inputs and chill, it checks if user inputs are floatable, floats, integers, contain floatable words, Yes/No etc.
gives back a bunch of True / False values.
stores the valid answers in a list called 'lanswe'. 'dinpok' dict stores the T/F values of the function checks when the function is called.
input() only accepts certain conditions which can be set in the while loop after the function.
'dinpok' is cleared before the second question / function call.
in case of using 'yntf' option for break condition you can assign the T/F value which is in dinpok[yntf] to dinpok['ans'] to have T/F as answer: dinpok['ans'] = dinpok['yntf'].
its commented, you will see how it does everything.
if you have easier ways of doing this or see bugs or have recommandations please tell me. thank you
